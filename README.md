Language: JavaScript (for business rules)
Modules: User Management, Task Table 2, Project Table NM
🧠 Project Objective
To automate and secure user, group, and role management by implementing workflow-based approvals and access controls.
The system ensures that:

Only authorized users can update records.
Workflow approvals (e.g., from Alice) are required for status changes.
Task progress and completion are tracked automatically.
🧾 Problem Statement
Manual management of user access and task approvals often leads to:

Delayed task completions
Unauthorized updates
Inconsistent access control across roles
This project addresses these issues by using ServiceNow Flow Designer to automate approvals and enforce ACL-based data protection.
